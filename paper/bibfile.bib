	abstract = {Introduction
Using public transit has been positively associated with active transportation mainly because it is typically required to access and egress stations and stops. Transit users may adopt a lifestyle that enables them to walk and bicycle more to destinations other than transit stops or stations. The relationship between public transit use and active transportation in Canada is analyzed with a focus on trip durations for trips taken.
Methods
Using a sample of the time use module of Canada’s General Social Survey (2005, n=10,867, weighted to represent 15,298,948 urban Canadians), meeting physical activity guidelines of 30min or more of moderate physical activity through walking on survey day was assessed using a logistic regression. Using public transit during the day was the main correlate, controlling for socio demographic characteristics and survey day.
Results
Transit users (8.5\%) met physical activity guidelines (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 1.66 and 2.78 respectively for bus and subway/train) by walking to public transit or to other destinations. Analysis of walk time by purpose showed that trip duration did not vary significantly between transit users and non-users once an individual walked for a specific purpose, but a higher proportion of transit users walked for each studied purpose.
Conclusion
Beyond the walks to public transit stops or stations, transit users perform more active transportation to destinations by taking more walk trips for various purposes. Developing transit infrastructure and providing proximity destinations in surrounding neighborhoods may provide health benefits beyond a reduction in travel related energy use and emissions.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To examine public support for active transportation (AT) policies and to identify demographic and behavioural predictors of support for each policy approach.Methods: Canadian adults aged 18 years and older (N = 2,868) provided information on demographic factors (e.g., age, income), place of residence (e.g., region, size of community), and the frequency with which they walked/wheeled or cycled to work or school in a typical week. In addition, they rated their support for AT-related policies (e.g., spending government money on more dedicated bicycle paths, offering tax credits for public transit passes, charging higher rates for parking to subsidize costs for AT infrastructure, changing the design of neighbourhoods and communities to encourage informal physical activity). Multinomial regressions examined demographics and AT behaviour as predictors of support for each policy approach, yielding a total of eight models.Results: Although most policy actions to promote AT were supported by Canadians, the level of support varied by the type of policy actions and by demographics and AT behaviour. A majority of Canadians supported policy approaches targeting environmental planning and fiscal measures that incentivized AT. A minority of Canadians supported policies aimed at regulation or coercive fiscal measures. The level of support for AT policies was higher among women, those with more education, younger respondents, those residing in central and eastern Canada, and individuals who engaged in AT.Conclusion: Canadians are supportive of policy actions to facilitate AT. This public support might be important for their future development and implementation.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;},

A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.},

This involves both an acknowledgement of the geographical components of human rights and of the human rights impacts of policies pertaining to transport provision and regulation. Relying upon urban theory on the `right to the city', we illustrate how public transport, while not the subject of an independent constitutional right, is central to accessing the objects of most constitutionally ensconced socio-economic rights, and is also an integral element of exercising various civil and political rights. Drawing from examples in contemporary Johannesburg, we accordingly argue that executive policy choices in relation to the provision and regulation of public transport should be assessed through a rights-based prism and should be subjected to dialogic interaction with the judiciary, within a substantive, rights-based understanding of mobility and urban accessibility.},

Author Karel Martens starts from the observation that for the last fifty years the focus of transportation planning and policy has been on the performance of the transport system and ways to improve it, without much attention being paid to the persons actually using -- or failing to use -- that transport system. There are far-reaching consequences of this approach, with some enjoying the fruits of the improvements in the transport system, while others have experienced a substantial deterioration in their situation. The growing body of academic evidence on the resulting disparities in mobility and accessibility, have been paralleled by increasingly vocal calls for policy changes to address the inequities that have developed over time. Drawing on philosophies of social justice, Transport Justice argues that governments have the fundamental duty of providing virtually every person with adequate transportation and thus of mitigating the social disparities that have been created over the past decades.  Critical reading for transport planners and students of transportation planning, this book develops a new approach to transportation planning that takes people as its starting point, and justice as its end.},

We argue that the process of adding value should adhere to the principles of open (geographic) data science, ensuring openness, transparency and reproducibility. We also contend that outreach, in the form of active communication and dissemination through dashboards, software and publication are key to engage end-users and ensure societal impact. Open data products have major benefits. First, they enable insights from highly sensitive, controlled and/or secure data which may not be accessible otherwise. Second, they can expand the use of commercial and administrative data for the public good leveraging on their high temporal frequency and geographic granularity. We also contend that there is a compelling need for open data products as we experience the current data revolution. New, emerging data sources are unprecedented in temporal frequency and geographical resolution, but they are large, unstructured, fragmented and often hard to access due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. By transforming raw (open or ``closed'') data into ready to use open data products, new dimensions of human geographical processes can be captured and analysed, as we illustrate with existing examples. We conclude by arguing that several parallels exist between the role that open source software played in enabling research on spatial analysis in the 90~s and early 2000s, and the opportunities that open data products offer to unlock the potential of new forms of (geo-)data.},

Based on available data from five metropolitan regions in Latin America (Bras{\'i}lia, Ciudad de M{\'e}xico, Montevideo, Santiago, and S{\~a}o Paulo), this manuscript seeks to reduce the theoretical gap in the transport literature through the development of metrics of distributive justice based on existing Origin-Destination transport surveys, which is expected to identify the characteristics that seem to govern a fairer transport system, as well as to inform practitioners and policy makers about the conditions driving fairer urban environments. In addition to contributions to the evaluation of transport policies with data from developing countries, the discussions presented in this paper intend to provide insights into the major role of selecting the principles of justice and the distributed resources to evaluate the degrees of fairness in transportation systems.},

  abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals' response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.},

  abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based GIS procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more ``gender sensitive'' and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.},

  abstract = {There is a lack of agreement regarding the theoretical framework that practitioners should use for accessibility assessment -- a measure of transport and land-use systems performance. Cumulative measures are simple and easy to interpret, while gravity-based measures are more sophisticated, resourceful, and less intuitive approaches. As such, this study aims to investigate whether the estimates of a simple cumulative opportunity measure are significantly different from those made using advanced gravity-based measures to understand if the former can be a substitute for the latter in practice and if a certain threshold of travel time can be recommended for different regions. We estimated cumulative and gravity-based accessibility using decay-probability density functions, decay-cumulative density functions, Gaussian, and a Log-Logistic decay-cumulative density functions using census commuting flows, car congested travel time and public transit schedules from eight metropolitan regions across Canada -- Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg, London, and Halifax. These measures of accessibility were tested for correlation, and we found that a coefficient of approximately 0.90 is reached when the threshold to calculate cumulative opportunities accessibility is set to the average commute time for both low- and non-low-wage jobs accessibility analyses by transit and motor vehicles. The paper provides evidence to support the reliability of cumulative accessibility, facilitates its broader adoption for evaluation of transport and land use interactions in North American cities, as well as opens opportunities to advance the equitable distribution of transport system benefits.},

Outputs of fitdist and fitdistcens functions are S3 objects, for which specific methods are provided, including summary, plot and quantile. This package also provides various functions to compare the fit of several distributions to the same data set and can handle to bootstrap parameter estimates. Detailed examples are given in food risk assessment, ecotoxicology and insurance contexts.},

We find that resources and daily travel strongly affect the time crunch index and are compounded by the large effect of sociodemographic vulnerability, namely being a woman, immigrant, or member of an ethnic minority, and having a condition of disability. Our analysis presents a new approach for transportation scholars to measure the relationship between social well-being and transportation grounded in several decades of social science research on time use and well-being.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Using public transit has been positively associated with active transportation mainly because it is typically required to access and egress stations and stops. Transit users may adopt a lifestyle that enables them to walk and bicycle more to destinations other than transit stops or stations. The relationship between public transit use and active transportation in Canada is analyzed with a focus on trip durations for trips taken.
Methods
Using a sample of the time use module of Canada’s General Social Survey (2005, n=10,867, weighted to represent 15,298,948 urban Canadians), meeting physical activity guidelines of 30min or more of moderate physical activity through walking on survey day was assessed using a logistic regression. Using public transit during the day was the main correlate, controlling for socio demographic characteristics and survey day.
Results
Transit users (8.5\%) met physical activity guidelines (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 1.66 and 2.78 respectively for bus and subway/train) by walking to public transit or to other destinations. Analysis of walk time by purpose showed that trip duration did not vary significantly between transit users and non-users once an individual walked for a specific purpose, but a higher proportion of transit users walked for each studied purpose.
Conclusion
Beyond the walks to public transit stops or stations, transit users perform more active transportation to destinations by taking more walk trips for various purposes. Developing transit infrastructure and providing proximity destinations in surrounding neighborhoods may provide health benefits beyond a reduction in travel related energy use and emissions.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To examine public support for active transportation (AT) policies and to identify demographic and behavioural predictors of support for each policy approach.Methods: Canadian adults aged 18 years and older (N = 2,868) provided information on demographic factors (e.g., age, income), place of residence (e.g., region, size of community), and the frequency with which they walked/wheeled or cycled to work or school in a typical week. In addition, they rated their support for AT-related policies (e.g., spending government money on more dedicated bicycle paths, offering tax credits for public transit passes, charging higher rates for parking to subsidize costs for AT infrastructure, changing the design of neighbourhoods and communities to encourage informal physical activity). Multinomial regressions examined demographics and AT behaviour as predictors of support for each policy approach, yielding a total of eight models.Results: Although most policy actions to promote AT were supported by Canadians, the level of support varied by the type of policy actions and by demographics and AT behaviour. A majority of Canadians supported policy approaches targeting environmental planning and fiscal measures that incentivized AT. A minority of Canadians supported policies aimed at regulation or coercive fiscal measures. The level of support for AT policies was higher among women, those with more education, younger respondents, those residing in central and eastern Canada, and individuals who engaged in AT.Conclusion: Canadians are supportive of policy actions to facilitate AT. This public support might be important for their future development and implementation.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;},
